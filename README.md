# STA418-Final-ShinyApp

This is a shiny app I created as a portion of a group project for STA 418 at Grand Valley. The purpose of this app is to allow users to find historical [CDC sanitation ratings](https://github.com/marks/cdc-cruise-ship-inspections) for cruise ships. Users can determine areas on the ship with the most violations and whether the ship has reported [gastrointestional illness outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm). Users can also download the raw data for the given cruise ship for additional analysis.


You can view the app [here](https://jasons99.shinyapps.io/shiny-for-STA418-final/)

This is uploaded seperately from the final report because I was unable to deploy the app included in the final report to shinyapps.io
